General note: It is with the story, the one preceding the click of the shutter but also of the brain when an idea pops into it – that Sophie Calle opens Because. She undertakes to tell us the reason, or at least one reason, that led her to press the shutter. The photograph is only revealed later, hidden in the interstices of the Japanese binding. Thus reversing the relationship of natural primacy between an image and the words that accompany it, Sophie Calle calls attention to the influence that the latter may have on our reception of a photograph. - Title from colophon.",

Each of the ten selected curators is known for his or her integrity and expertise in staging presentations of new art on an international level. Each curator selects ten important new artists who have either emerged internationally over the last five years or who are still relatively unknown. There are no limitations on age, geography or medium. The result is a roster of the most significant and promising new artists working today -- the true cream of the crop. Each curator also selects a key creative work for the Sources section, such as an art work, text, film or album that has been significantly influential to art being produced at this moment, contextualizing the contemporary work featured in the rest of the book. The curators: Tirdad Zolghadr, Chus Martinez, Catherine Wood, Douglas Fogle, Kitty Scott, Ines Katzenstein, Ines Katzenstein, Elena Filipovic, Yukie Kamiya.",

    "description": "Through the use of various media, Annaïk Lou Pitteloud, who grew up in Lausanne and now lives in Brussels, directs the viewer’s gaze, the observer, to invisible elements that belong to the construction of the image, to institutional space or to the actual creative activity. Simple and direct, Pitteloud’s works pose critical questions about social problems and reveal the sometimes frozen mechanisms of the art world and the codes of perception, mediation and presentation of art.With the modular work documentation “Folder”, Annaïk Lou Pitteloud presents for the first time a comprehensive publication on her artistic work to date. The publication is preceded by the two sub-publications “Folder” and “Dossier”. As catalogues for the solo exhibitions at the Kunstmuseum St. Gallen and the Musée cantonal des Beaux-Arts in Lausanne, they contain different compilations of the artist’s works that are related to the respective exhibitions and thus illustrate the basic idea of the present modular documentation of works. Files on all the artist’s works are created according to a strict grid. Separated by type of content, titles, descriptions of works, notes, documentary images and texts are compiled. Reproductions of drawings and reprints of printed matter used in the exhibitions complete the collection.This archive forms the basis for the monographic publications, in that a suitable selection of works can be compiled and published according to the occasion of the publication. The individual sheets, which are held together by pad binding, have three punched holes and suggest that the contents can also later be disassembled, rearranged or supplemented and filed in a folder. Authors: Maziar Afrassiabi, Madeleine Amsler, Pavel Büchler, Barnaby Drabble, Bethan Huws, Marie-Eve Knoerle, Federica Martini, Hans Rudolf Reust, Nicole Schweizer, Steve Van den Bosch, Nadia Veronese.
